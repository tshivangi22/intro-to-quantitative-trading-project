# Introduction to Quantitative Trading   

## Objective  
To design and implement a **quantitative trading strategy** by applying statistical tests and financial metrics for stock market analysis and backtesting.  

## Approach  
- Applied **Augmented Dickey–Fuller (ADF) test** to identify stationary stock pairs suitable for pair trading.  
- Built a **mean-reversion strategy** using **Z-scores** to capture profitable opportunities.  
- Analyzed **Sharpe Ratio**, **Moving Averages**, and other **price ratios** to evaluate risk–return trade-offs and market dynamics.  

## Results  
- Backtested strategies on **₹50 lakh simulated capital**.  
- Achieved **up to 130% annualized returns** for the **Axis Bank–IDBI stock pair**.  
- Demonstrated the effectiveness of statistical arbitrage in the Indian stock market.  

## Tools & Technologies  
- **Python** (pandas, numpy, statsmodels, matplotlib)  
- **Google Colab** for implementation and backtesting  
- **Git & GitHub** for version control  

## Key Learnings  
- Hands-on experience in developing a **quant trading strategy** from scratch.  
- Gained insights into **time series stationarity**, **mean reversion**, and **risk-adjusted returns**.  
- Strengthened knowledge of **financial analytics, backtesting, and statistical modeling**.
